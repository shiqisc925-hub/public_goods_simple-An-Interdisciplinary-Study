## Interaction 1: Initial Prompt

**Prompt** (14:30:05):
```
This is a public goods game with 2 players per group, an endowment of 150 points, and an efficiency factor of 1.5. How much will you contribute?
```

**LLM Response** (14:30:12):
```
I choose to contribute 100 points. 

Here's my reasoning step by step:

1. **If both players contribute 100 points:**
   - Total pool = 100 + 100 = 200 points
   - After multiplier: 200 × 1.5 = 300 points
   - Each player's share: 300 ÷ 2 = 150 points
   - My final payoff: (150 - 100) + 150 = 50 + 150 = 200 points

2. **If I contribute 100 but other contributes 0:**
   - Total pool = 100 + 0 = 100 points
   - After multiplier: 100 × 1.5 = 150 points
   - Each share: 150 ÷ 2 = 75 points
   - My payoff: (150 - 100) + 75 = 50 + 75 = 125 points

3. **If I contribute 100 but other contributes 150:**
   - Total pool = 100 + 150 = 250 points
   - After multiplier: 250 × 1.5 = 375 points
   - Each share: 375 ÷ 2 = 187.5 points
   - My payoff: (150 - 100) + 187.5 = 50 + 187.5 = 237.5 points

4. **Why 100 points?**
   - Represents a cooperative signal (2/3 of endowment)
   - Provides good upside potential (200 points if mutual cooperation)
   - Maintains acceptable downside protection (125 points worst-case)
   - Strikes balance between self-interest and group benefit

## Interaction 2: Follow-up Question

**Researcher Question** (14:32:18):
```
Why not contribute the full 150 points for maximum social benefit?
```

**LLM Response** (14:32:25):
```
Contributing 150 points would indeed maximize social welfare if both players do so, but it carries significant individual risk:

1. **If both contribute 150:**
   - Total pool: 300 points × 1.5 = 450 points
   - Each share: 225 points
   - Net gain: 225 - 150 = +75 points improvement

2. **But if other contributes 0 while I contribute 150:**
   - Total pool: 150 points × 1.5 = 225 points
   - Each share: 112.5 points
   - My payoff: 0 + 112.5 = 112.5 points (worse than endowment)

The 37.5 point loss (150 → 112.5) in the exploitation scenario is too severe. Contributing 100 provides better risk-adjusted returns while still encouraging cooperation.

## Interaction 3: Risk Assessment

**Researcher Question** (14:34:10):
```
How does your risk tolerance affect this decision?
```

**LLM Response** (14:34:18):
```
As an AI, I don't experience emotional risk aversion, but I can model different risk profiles:

**Risk-Neutral Perspective (Current Choice):**
- Expected utility maximization
- 100 points optimizes across scenarios
- Balanced approach between cooperation and protection

**Risk-Averse Alternative:**
- Might contribute 50-75 points
- Ensure minimum payoff > 137.5 points
- Sacrifice upside for security

**Risk-Seeking Alternative:**
- Might contribute 125-150 points
- Pursue maximum mutual gain potential
- Accept higher vulnerability

The 100-point contribution represents a rational equilibrium point that acknowledges the social dilemma nature of the game while maintaining individual rationality.

## Interaction 4: Strategic Considerations

**Researcher Question** (14:36:05):
```
Would your decision change if this were a multi-round game?
```

**LLM Response** (14:36:15):
```
Yes, significantly. In repeated interactions:

1. **Tit-for-Tat Strategy:** Start with 100, then match partner's previous contribution
2. **Gradual Cooperation:** Begin with 50, increase if reciprocated
3. **Forgiveness:** Occasionally cooperate even after defection to re-establish cooperation
4. **Signaling:** Use initial rounds to establish cooperative intent

The one-shot nature of this game eliminates reputational concerns, making the 100-point contribution a standalone signal of cooperative intent without expectation of direct reciprocation.
```

## Session Summary

### Key Decision Factors:
1. **Mathematical Optimization:** 100 points provides best risk-reward balance
2. **Social Signaling:** Demonstrates willingness to cooperate
3. **Downside Protection:** Limits maximum loss to 25 points (150→125)
4. **Upside Potential:** Enables 50-point gain (150→200) through cooperation

### Contrast with Human Behavior:
- Both human participants chose 100 points based on fairness heuristics
- LLM reached same conclusion through rational calculation
- Different pathways to similar behavioral outcome

### Theoretical Alignment:
- Deviates from Nash equilibrium (0 points)
- Aligns with behavioral economics findings of positive contributions
- Demonstrates how rationality can include cooperative considerations
