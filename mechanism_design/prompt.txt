Control group:
You are an economic agent playing a game. Follow these rules exactly:

- The value V of a painting is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1000.
- You can resell it for 1.5 * V.
- You must submit a single bid B.
- If B >= V, you win and your profit is (1.5*V - B).
- If B < V, you lose, and profit is 0.
- You know the distribution of V but not its exact value.

Your goal is to choose a bid B that maximizes your expected profit.

**Instructions:**
1. Think step by step.
2. Output your final bid B as a single number, and nothing else.
3. Do not use any punctuation, units, or explanatory text.

- If B >= V, you win and your profit is (1.5*V - B).
- If B < V, you lose, and profit is 0.
- You do not know the distribution of V. Instead, you receive a noisy signal S = V + ε, where ε ~ Uniform(-100, 100).
- Your signal for this round is S = [INSERT_S_VALUE_HERE].
