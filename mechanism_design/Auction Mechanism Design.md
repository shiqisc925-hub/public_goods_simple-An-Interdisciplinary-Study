# Auction Mechanism Design

## 1. Auction Format Selection

The auction format selected for this study is a **unilateral sealed-bid auction**, based on **Game #37** from the "Games and Behavior" module.

## 2. Basic Auction Rules

### Value Distribution
- The true value $V$ of the painting follows a uniform distribution: $V \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1000)$

### Bidding Rules
- Bidders submit a sealed bid $B$
- If $B \geq V$, the bidder wins the auction
- If $B < V$, the bidder loses the auction

### Profit Calculation
- Profit when winning: $\text{Profit} = 1.5V - B$
- Profit when losing: $0$

## 3. Experimental Group Design

### Control Group (Full Information)
- Bidders know the value distribution: $V \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1000)$
- Bidders do not know the specific value of $V$ in each round
- Establishes a baseline for rational bidding behavior under perfect distributional information

### Treatment Group (Noisy Signal)
- Bidders do not know the distribution of $V$
- Bidders receive a noisy private signal $S$ generated by:
  $$S = V + \varepsilon,\quad \text{where}\ \varepsilon \sim \text{Uniform}(-100, 100)$$
- Bidders are informed of the signal generation process and receive the specific signal value each round (e.g., $S = 650$)
- This manipulation removes bidders' awareness of the base-rate distribution, forcing reliance on potentially biased point estimates

## 4. Theoretical Safety Net Design

The profit function $\text{Profit} = 1.5V - B$ serves as a theoretical safety net:
- For any winning bid ($B \geq V$), profit is non-negative:
  $$1.5V - B \geq 1.5V - V = 0.5V > 0$$
- Shifts the economic manifestation of winner's curse from **binary loss outcomes** to **continuous metrics of profit efficiency**

## 5. Profit Efficiency Metric

Introduced the **Profit Efficiency Ratio** to measure the severity of winner's curse:

$$\text{Profit Efficiency} = \frac{1.5V - B}{0.5V}$$

- **Efficiency = 1**: Perfect bid ($B = V$), capturing entire surplus
- **Efficiency close to 0**: Severe winner's curse, most potential profit paid to seller

## 6. Experimental Execution Parameters

### Number of Rounds
- Total rounds: 10 rounds
- Rounds 1-5: GPT-4 model
- Rounds 6-10: DeepSeek model

### Value Generation
- $V$: Randomly generated from $\text{Uniform}(0, 1000)$
- $\varepsilon$: Randomly generated from $\text{Uniform}(-100, 100)$
- $S$: Calculated as $S = V + \varepsilon$

### Experimental Isolation
- Each round conducted in separate, isolated chat dialogues
- Prevents any context carry-over between rounds

## 7. Prompt Design

### Control Group Prompt
```
You are an economic agent playing a game. Follow these rules exactly:

- The value V of a painting is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1000.
- You can resell it for 1.5 * V.
- You must submit a single bid B.
- If B >= V, you win and your profit is (1.5*V - B).
- If B < V, you lose, and profit is 0.
- You know the distribution of V but not its exact value.

Your goal is to choose a bid B that maximizes your expected profit.

**Instructions:**
1. Think step by step.
2. Output your final bid B as a single number, and nothing else.
3. Do not use any punctuation, units, or explanatory text.

What is your optimal bid B?
```

### Treatment Group Prompt

You are an economic agent playing a game. Follow these rules exactly:

- You must submit a single bid B.
- If B >= V, you win and your profit is (1.5*V - B).
- If B < V, you lose, and profit is 0.
- You do not know the distribution of V. Instead, you receive a noisy signal S = V + ε, where ε ~ Uniform(-100, 100).
- Your signal for this round is S = [INSERT_S_VALUE_HERE].

Your goal is to choose a bid B that maximizes your expected profit.

**Instructions:**
1. Think step by step.
2. Output your final bid B as a single number, and nothing else.
3. Do not use any punctuation, units, or explanatory text.

```

## 8. Hypothesis Testing

### Behavioral Mechanism Hypothesis
- Treatment group bidders will **overweight the noisy signal** $S$ (anchoring bias)
- Treatment group bidders will **underweight the prior distribution**
- Leads to systematic **upward shift in bid distribution** compared to control group

### Economic Outcome Hypothesis
- Higher bids will cause **significant erosion of profit potential**
- Results in **lower profit efficiency**, despite impossibility of outright monetary loss in this framework

## 9. Literature Support

This experimental design is grounded in established literature:
- Kagel and Levin (2002): Standard method for inducing winner's curse in laboratory settings
- Bazerman and Samuelson (1983): Anchoring bias and signal overweighting
- Capen, Clapp, and Campbell (1971): Economic consequences of winner's curse

This design adapts a classic experimental paradigm to test whether LLMs exhibit well-documented human biases, using refined economic metrics to capture its effects.
